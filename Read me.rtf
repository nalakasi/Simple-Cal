This code is a simple calculator program written in Python. Here's how it works:
	1	Language: The code is written in Python, a popular programming language known for being easy to read and write.
	2	Functionality:
	◦	The calculator offers four basic operations: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.
	◦	It prompts the user to select an operation by entering a number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
	◦	After the operation is selected, it asks the user to input two numbers.
	◦	The program then performs the chosen calculation and displays the result.
	◦	If the user selects division, the program checks to make sure the second number isn't zero (since dividing by zero causes an error).
	3	Loop & Exit:
	◦	The program keeps running in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations.
	◦	The user can exit the calculator by selecting option 5.
It's a simple and interactive way to perform basic math operations using Python!
